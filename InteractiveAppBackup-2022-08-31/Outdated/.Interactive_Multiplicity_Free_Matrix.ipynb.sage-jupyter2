The support of a multisegment is the multiset of all segment elements contained in it. To use the tool, input a multisegment into the text box in the following format:\n\n$$[[i_1,j_1],[i_2,j_2],...,[i_n,j_n]]$$\n\nwhere $i_k \\leq j_k$ for each $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Once you have your desired multisegment, simply press the \"Run Algorithm\" button to obtain its associated multiplicity matrix. If the inputted multisegment is not multiplicity free a warning will be displayed and nothing else. Three check\\-boxes are given to customize the output: \"Zeros\" controls if the zeros in the multiplicity matrix are displayed, \"Max Matrix\" controls if the multiplicity matrix of the root multisegment is displayed, and \"Print Multisegments\" controls if the multisegments appearing in the matrix are printed for later use. The multisegments in the table were ordered such that the matrix is upper\\-triangular. Note that all entries in this matrix are either zeros or ones, with ones occurring if the entry $(\\pi(a),\\langle b \\rangle)$ if and only if $a \\geq b$ in the multisegment ordering. This is an application of Theorem 9.13 in \"Induced representations of reductive p\\-adic groups. II.\" by A. V. Zelevinsky. The default arrangement of the table is the for the sub-sub or quotient-quotient picture, but if one wishes to look at the sub-quotient or quotient-sub picture instead, simply press the \"Mix\" button.\n\n**Notation**: Let $a = \\{\\Delta_1,...,\\Delta_k\\}$ be a multisegment. We denote the unique irreducible quotient/sub associated with $\\Delta_i$ by $Z(\\Delta_i),Q(\\Delta_i)$. Suppose $Z(\\Delta_i),Q(\\Delta_i)$ are irreps of $\\text{GL}_{n_i}$. Then we denote the standard modules by \\begin{equation*}\n\\pi_Z(a)=\\text{Ind}_{(n_1,...,n_t)}^{(n_1+...+n_t)}(Z(\\Delta_1)\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes Z(\\Delta_k))\n\\end{equation*}\nand \\begin{equation*}\n\\pi_Q(a)=\\text{Ind}_{(n_1,...,n_t)}^{(n_1+...+n_t)}(Q(\\Delta_1)\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes Q(\\Delta_k))\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere we borrow the induction notation from \"Induced representations of reductive $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic groups.
